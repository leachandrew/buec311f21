# Incentives Example: England's window tax

# Wolfers and Stevenson's Basic Principles

Principle # 1: The cost-benefit principle

- What are the benefits and costs of each decision?
- Why do we measure in dollars?
   - "Economists love dollars as much as architects love inches"
- Are you getting a good deal?

- Or what?
   - should I take this class or that one?
   - should I major in BUEC or MKTG
   - should I take this job or this internship?
- What's my next-best alternative?

# Why We Model I

.pull-left[

- Economists often "speak" in models that explain and predict human behavior

- The language of models is mathematics

- Mathematical inference is expressed through equations and graphs

- This is what scares students most about economics. Don't let it scare you.

# Why We Model II

.pull-left[

- Economists use conceptual models: fictional constructions to logically examine consequences

- Economics is broader than just mathematical models:
    - Economists run experiments
    - Economists analyze data
    - Economists make predictions
    
- Math is a tool, it's not the goal

# Remember: All Models are Wrong!

.content-box-red[
.red[**Caution**:] Don't conflate models with reality!
]
- Models help us *understand* reality.

- A good economist is always aware of:
    - the limits of their model
    - the key underlying assumptions
    - " _ceteris paribus_ " (all else equal)
    - "...and then what?"   (is the system in equilibrium?)
    - "...compared to what?" (counterfactual analysis)

# Positive and Normative Statements
- Economics alone can't tell you the **right** decision 
- A positive statement is a statement of what **is** or what **will happen** and describes reality.
   - If you increase the costs of production, consumer prices will go up.
- Positive statements can reflect **uncertainty** about outcomes
- A normative statement concerns what somebody believes **should** happen:
   - “The government should tax greenhouse gas emissions.”
   - Normative statements cannot be tested because they imply value judgments which cannot be refuted by evidence.
- Normative statements can inform objective functions
   - A decision-maker might look for a policy which does not increase inequality
   - Economists can provide constrained advice: this policy accomplishes your objective and **is unlikely to** increase inequality
