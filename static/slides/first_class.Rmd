- Some quick facts about me:
  - I grew up in Ottawa
  - I have degrees in environmental science, economics and (soon) law
  - My academic interests are environmental policy and energy markets
  - I've also worked in various governmental advisory roles
  - This is my first time teaching this class and I'm excited to share my passion for economics with you

# Learning Objectives

.pull-left[
- The language of economics
  - What do you mean by...
- Economics as a tool for decision making
  - How to use economics to become a better manager, policy analyst, etc.
- Why economic models are wrong
  - The importance of simplification
- When, why, and how to use them
  - Used correctly, a simple model can be a powerful tool
  - Used incorrectly, the same model can lead to bad decisions

# Micro- vs. Macro-economics

.pull-left[

- Macroeconomics studies the economy: the interactions of economic agents (people, firms, governments) over time
- Macro uses aggregates (GDP, unemployment, & inflation) and studies the behaviour of these measures in response to shocks
- Microeconomics is the study of constrained choices and consequences by individual economic agents
- Macroeconomics is what happens when you put all the micro together

# What about Managerial Economics?

.pull-left[

- Managerial economics is effectively applied microeconomics with a focus on management
- More emphasis on the theory of the firm, profit maximization, competition, and strategy
- You'll see (I hope) elements of your business plans, case studies, and other business stratrgy translated into a different language

# What does an economist mean when they say...

.pull-left[

- Terms you "know" from ordinary life mean .hi[very different things] to economists:

> Cost, efficiency, welfare, marginal, profit, public good, discrimination, elasticity, games

- Using these words' "ordinary" meanings will lead to wrong economic conclusions!

- You will need to "relearn" the economic meanings of these words

# Economics has its own vocabulary

.pull-left[

- You'll need to master a new vocabulary:

> externality, marginal rate of transformation, marginal cost, consumer surplus, allocative efficiency

- While I'll try to avoid jargon, I'll be pedantic about certain terms with you because they are important for understanding and to convey consistent meanings

# You Can Learn To Think Like an Economist

.pull-left[

- People often think they are already an economist and can speak this foreign language

- Be humble, and open to new ideas

- Economics is *often* common sense, but it takes time to grasp and apply the tools

- Don't give up too soon

# Incentives Example: England's window tax

# More vocabulary

# Why We Model I

.pull-left[

- Economists often "speak" in models that explain and predict human behavior

- The language of models is mathematics

- Mathematical inference is expressed through equations and graphs

- This is what scares students most about economics. Don't let it scare you.

# Why We Model II

.pull-left[

- Economists use conceptual models: fictional constructions to logically examine consequences

- Economics is broader than just mathematical models:
    - Economists run experiments
    - Economists analyze data
    - Economists make predictions
    
- Math is a tool, it's not the goal

# Remember: All Models are Wrong!

.content-box-red[
.red[**Caution**:] Don't conflate models with reality!
]
- Models help us *understand* reality.

- A good economist is always aware of:
    - the limits of their model
    - the key underlying assumptions
    - " _ceteris paribus_ " (all else equal)
    - "...and then what?"   (is the system in equilibrium?)
    - "...compared to what?" (counterfactual analysis)

# Positive and Normative Statements
- Economics alone can't tell you the **right** decision 
- A positive statement is a statement of what **is** or what **will happen** and describes reality.
   - If you increase the costs of production, consumer prices will go up.
- Positive statements can reflect **uncertainty** about outcomes
- A normative statement concerns what somebody believes **should** happen:
   - “The government should tax greenhouse gas emissions.”
   - Normative statements cannot be tested because they imply value judgments which cannot be refuted by evidence.
- Normative statements can inform objective functions
   - A decision-maker might look for a policy which does not increase inequality
   - Economists can provide constrained advice: this policy accomplishes your objective and **is unlikely to** increase inequality

# About This Course

---

# Learning Goals

By the end of this course, you will: 

1. apply economic models to managerial and government decisions

2. explore the effects of economic and political processes on market performance
  - competition, market prices, profits and losses, property rights, entrepreneurship, market power, market failures, public policy, government failures

3. apply the economic way of thinking to real world issues

4. be able to access and interpret relevant economic data

---
# On-line learning setup

- Regular class meetings will be on Zoom, with Google Meet as a backup
- Each section will have 2 weekly synchronous meetings, plus a recorded problem solving and review session
  - T/TH classes during scheduled meeting times will last only (approximately) 50 minutes, supplemented by the recorded problem solving and review session
  - M/W/F classes will have synchronous meetings during the first two scheduled meeting times of the week (usually M/W, unless M is a holiday) and the third class session will be the asynchronous problem solving and review class
- At least one session for each will be recorded during the week, and posted on the eClass site to allow you to catch up
