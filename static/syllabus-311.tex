\section{Course Description}\label{course-description}}

Economics is the study of human decision making, and the ways in which
those decisions interact. In this course, through the application of
economic theory, you will improve your understanding of complex decision
making within organizations and learn to apply an economic lens to
predict resultant outcomes. At the end of this course, you will have
developed specific skills and knowledge of microeconomics, economic
models of decision making, and the ability to apply these models in
various settings.

The course begins with revision and application of key economic concepts
such as supply, demand, and elasticity. We'll delve deeper into consumer
choice theory and introduce some concepts from behavioural economics.
From the consumer, we'll next look at the organization of individual
firms, including how firms make production decisions and how different
types of costs affect these decisions. Armed with these tools, we'll
study market structures. We'll start with perfect competition: the ideal
outcome in a competitive market, at least from the point of view of
social welfare. From there, we'll examine more realistic and challenging
market structures, in particular monopolies and oligopolies, and compare
market outcomes under these conditions with those under the ideal
competitive market. We next look in detail at firm decision making in
areas such as entry and exit from the market, as well as important
business strategies such as pricing, advertising, and investing in new
capital. Finally, we'll discuss other ways that markets fail, with a
particular emphasis on the economics of pollution control and climate
change. Time permitting, we'll expand some of these concepts to look at
consumer and firm decision-making under risk and uncertainty.

The prerequisites of this course are ECON 101, ECON 102, and MATH 113 or
equivalent. Students may receive credit for only one of BUEC 301, BUEC
311, MANEC 301 or ECON 383. The course is not open to students with
previous credit in ECON 281.

\hypertarget{course-material}{%
\section{Course Material}\label{course-material}}

While no textbook is explicitly required, the course will follow the
treatment of topics in:

\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}{.8\linewidth}
Perloff, Jeffrey M., and James A. Brander. \textit{Managerial Economics and Strategy}. 3rd ed. Hoboken, NJ: Pearson, 2020.
\end{minipage}
\end{center}

I will only test you on my own notes and lecture content, and my goal is
to build a course-pack that will replace the textbook in years to come.
What this means is that, if you're not going to attend class and/or
you're going to do other things during lectures, you should probably buy
and use the book. If you think that you'll want extra problem sets, you
should buy the book and the MyLab add-on. The 3rd edition was new last
year, but if you want to use an older edition of the book, that's likely
to be fine, although the examples provided may be different from the new
edition. Problem sets from other intermediate microeconomics or
managerial economics texts may help you as well. There is also an
electronic version of the book available which you may consider. Please
keep in mind that it is unlikely that reserve copies will be available
from the library during the term.

Beyond the textbook, any readings or other resources I use will be
available freely online or available through the University of Alberta
Libraries on-line access. You are also expected to remain up-to-date on
economic policy issues in the news, in particular if you want to be
successful in the \textit{Flipgrid} assignment. The topics of discussion
may change through the term depending on what's happening around us.

Material will be provided through the combined \href{https://eclass.srv.ualberta.ca/course/view.php?id=70884}{eClass} site, supplemented by my own \href{https://buec311.aleach.ca}{website} for the class as a
backup. I plan to make recordings of class delivery available, so please
advise if you have objections to this approach so that I can explore
alternatives.

Please do not download all the course content immediately as I plan to
update it through the term. All the links in eClass to lecture material
will be done through external resource / GitHub links so that eClass
always links to the latest version of the material. I will advise you of
any short-notice updates to the degree that I can.

\hypertarget{course-material}{%
\section{Assignments}\label{course-material}}

\hypertarget{video-discussion---teams-20}{%
\subsection{Video discussion - Teams
(20\%)}\label{video-discussion---teams-20}}

Using the FlipGrid App, I've created a video discussion board for the
class. Over the course of the term, I expect you to participate in the
discussion board or to confirm an alternative with me (e.g.~submit
discussion materials privately). You can participate in the discussion
board as often as you like, however you may only be graded on one
intervention per month, and that will be graded on a 5 point scale. Your
four monthly grades from the semester count for your 20\% grade
regardless of how often you post.

\hypertarget{quizzes-20}{%
\subsection{Quizzes (20\%)}\label{quizzes-20}}

I'll use two quizzes during the term, one before the midterm and one
before the final, to give you a preview of what I'm expecting from you
and a chance for you to see how you're doing with the material. Quizzes
will be open-book and will focus on the mechanical aspects of the course
material, while the midterm and final will ask you to do more
interpretation.

\hypertarget{midterm-exam-20}{%
\subsection{Midterm Exam (20\%)}\label{midterm-exam-20}}

The midterm exam will be open-book and will feature different
permutations of questions for different groups (i.e.~you'll all get
similar problems, but your problem might not have the same values in the
equation, or you might be asked a slightly different question about the
solution).

\hypertarget{final-exam---40}{%
\subsection{Final Exam - (40\%)}\label{final-exam---40}}

Like the midterm, the final exam will be open-book, and will feature
different permutations and order of questions among students. Exact
parameters TBD. Subject to approval from Exams and Timetabling, a
consolidated exam will be scheduled as follows:

\begin{table}[!h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{cc}
\toprule
Section & Date\\
\midrule
All sections & Dec 22 @ 09:00 AM MT\\
Conflicts & Dec 22 @ 02:00 PM MT\\

\hypertarget{section-coordination}{%
\section{Section Coordination}\label{section-coordination}}

The three fall sections of BUEC-311 will follow the same schedule with
the same deliverables. Given the size of the sections, it is preferable
that you attend your assigned section. However, the coordination enables
you to benefit from the recording of lecture materials from other
sections, or to source notes from colleagues in other sections.

\hypertarget{teaching-assistants}{%
\section{Teaching Assistants}\label{teaching-assistants}}

There will be 5 teaching assistants for the class. Teaching assistants
will be responsible for grading video assignments and will also be
available to help you with problem sets and course material at scheduled
times.

\hypertarget{communication}{%
\section{Communication}\label{communication}}

I will generally use email to send you messages relating to class
content. I will handle office hours and other help requests either
in-person or via Google Meet or Zoom. You can always email me with
questions, but please put BUEC-311 in the subject line as that will help
me to make sure I do not miss your message. You are always welcome to
drop by my office with questions as well.

\hypertarget{accommodation}{%
\section{Accommodation}\label{accommodation}}

COVID continues to affect our learning environment. I am willing to help
accommodate your personal circumstances, whether COVID-related or
otherwise, to the best of my abilities and within University policies.
If you are in a position where you require special accommodation, please
let me know sooner rather than later. If your circumstances change
throughout the term, my goal is to help you continue to be successful in
the class. In return, I ask that you keep in mind that faculty and staff
at the university are also adjusting to rapidly changing guidelines with
respect to COVID, and so your patience is going to be required at times
with technology, last-minute changes, etc.

\hypertarget{class-schedule}{%
\section{Class Schedule}\label{class-schedule}}

This is a rough outline for the semester. Actual class content may vary
over the course of the term and exam dates and deadlines to be finalized
closer to dates, and subject to University guidelines. Textbook
references are to the Perloff and Brander 3rd Edition text, although not
all material in each chapter will be covered, and supplemental material
will be added.

\section{Academic Misconduct}\label{academic-misconduct}}

``The University of Alberta is committed to the highest standards of
academic integrity and honesty. Students are expected to be familiar
with these standards regarding academic honesty and to uphold the
policies of the University in this respect. Students are particularly
urged to familiarize themselves with the provisions of the Code of
Student Behavior (\url{http://www.ualberta.ca/secretariat/appeals.htm})
and avoid any behavior which could potentially result in suspicions of
cheating, plagiarism, misrepresentation of facts and/or participation in
an offence. Academic dishonesty is a serious offence and can result in
suspension or expulsion from the University." (GFC 29 Sep 2003)

I will take any and all incidents of plagiarism seriously. It is your
responsibility to ensure that you are familiar with the rules that
govern academic misconduct, in particular the following section:

30.3.2 Inappropriate Academic Behaviour, 30.3.2(1) Plagiarism

``No Student shall submit the words, ideas, images or data of another
person as the Student's own in any academic writing, essay, thesis,
project, assignment, presentation or poster in a course or program of
study."
