\section{Course Description}\label{course-description}}

Economics is the study of human decision making, and the ways in which
those decisions interact. In this course, through the application of
economic theory, you will improve your understanding of complex decision
making within organizations and learn to apply an economic lens to
predict resultant outcomes. At the end of this course, you will have
developed specific skills and knowledge of microeconomics, economic
models of decision making, and the ability to apply these models in
various settings.

The course begins with revision and application of key economic concepts
such as supply, demand, and elasticity. We'll delve deeper into consumer
choice theory and introduce some concepts from behavioural economics.
From the consumer, we'll next look at the organization of individual
firms, including how firms make production decisions and how different
types of costs affect these decisions. Armed with these tools, we'll
study market structures. We'll start with perfect competition: the ideal
outcome in a competitive market, at least from the point of view of
social welfare. From there, we'll examine more realistic and challenging
market structures, in particular monopolies and oligopolies, and compare
market outcomes under these conditions with those under the ideal
competitive market. We next look in detail at firm decision making in
areas such as entry and exit from the market, as well as important
business strategies such as pricing, advertising, and investing in new
capital. Finally, we'll discuss other ways that markets fail, with a
particular emphasis on the economics of pollution control and climate
change. Time permitting, we'll expand some of these concepts to look at
consumer and firm decision-making under risk and uncertainty.

The prerequisites of this course are ECON 101, ECON 102, and MATH 113 or
equivalent. Students may receive credit for only one of BUEC 301, BUEC
311, MANEC 301 or ECON 383. The course is not open to students with
previous credit in ECON 281.

\hypertarget{course-material}{%
\section{Course Material}\label{course-material}}

While no textbook is explicitly required, the course will follow the
treatment of topics in:

\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}{.8\linewidth}
Perloff, Jeffrey M., and James A. Brander. \textit{Managerial Economics and Strategy}. 3rd ed. Hoboken, NJ: Pearson, 2020.
\end{minipage}
\end{center}

I will only test you on my own notes and lecture content, and my goal is
to build a course-pack that will replace the textbook in years to come.
What this means is that, if you're not going to attend class and/or
you're going to do other things during lectures, you should probably buy
and use the book. If you think that you'll want extra problem sets, you
should buy the book and the MyLab add-on. The 3rd edition is new this
year, but if you want to use an older edition of the book, that's likely
to be fine, although the examples provided may be different from the new
edition. Problem sets from other intermediate microeconomics or
managerial economics texts may help you as well. There is also an
electronic version of the book available which you may consider. Please
keep in mind that it is unlikely that reserve copies will be available
from the library during the term.

Beyond the textbook, any readings or other resources I use will be
available freely online or available through the University of Alberta
Libraries on-line access. You are also expected to remain up-to-date on
economic policy issues in the news, in particular if you want to be
successful in the \textit{Breakout Briefings}. The topics of discussion
may change through the term depending on what's happening around us.

Class content will be delivered on-line, via Zoom, as well as through
the combined eClass site. I plan to make recordings of class delivery
available, so please advise if you have objections to this approach so
that I can explore alternatives.

Please do not download all the course content immediately as I plan to
update it through the term. All the links in eClass to lecture material
will be done through Google Drive links so that eClass always links to
the latest version of the material. I will advise you of any
short-notice updates to the degree that I can.

\hypertarget{assignments}{%
\section{Assignments}\label{assignments}}

\hypertarget{video-discussion---teams-20}{%
\subsection{Video discussion - Teams
(20\%)}\label{video-discussion---teams-20}}

Using the FlipGrid App, I've created a video discussion board for the
class. Over the course of the term, I expect you to participate in the
discussion board to to confirm an alternative with me (e.g.~submit
discussion materials privately). You can participate in the discussion
board as often as you like, with each intervention graded on a 5 point
scale. Your top 4 individual grades from the semester count for your
20\% graderegardless of how often you post. Most weeks during term, I'll
assign you to Zoom breakout rooms for a discussion of a class topic
which could seed the video discussion and, if you'd like, you're welcome
to post a video from your breakout room to the discussion board. NB:
This replaces the Breakout Briefing which, for technical reasons, was
not feasible.

\hypertarget{quizzes-20}{%
\subsection{Quizzes (20\%)}\label{quizzes-20}}

I'll use two on-line quizzes through the term, one before the midterm
and one before the final, to give you a preview of what I'm expecting
from you and a chance for you to see how you're doing with the material.
Quizzes will focus on the mechanical aspects of the course material,
while midterms and finals will ask you to do more interpretation.

\hypertarget{midterm-exam-20}{%
\subsection{Midterm Exam (20\%)}\label{midterm-exam-20}}

Midterm exam will be open-book, completed on-line, and will feature
different permutations of questions for different groups (i.e.~you'll
all get the same problem, but your problem might not have the same
values in the equation, or you might be asked a slightly different
question about the solution). Exact parameters TBD.

\hypertarget{final-exam---40}{%
\subsection{Final Exam - (40\%)}\label{final-exam---40}}

Like the midterm, the final exam will be open-book, completed on-line,
and will feature different permutations and order of questions among
students. Exact parameters TBD. Subject to approval from Exams and
Timetabling, a consolidated exam will be scheduled as follows:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{cc}
\toprule
Section & Date\\
\midrule
All sections & Dec 12 @ 09:00 AM MT\\
Conflicts & Dec 12 @ 02:00 PM MT\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\hypertarget{grading}{%
\section{Grading}\label{grading}}

Percentage grades will be converted to letter grades as follows:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\toprule
Minimum & Maximum & Grade\\
\midrule
90 & 100.00 & A+\\
85 & 89.99 & A\\
80 & 84.99 & A-\\
77 & 79.99 & B+\\
73 & 76.99 & B\\
70 & 72.99 & B-\\
55 & 59.99 & D+\\
67 & 69.99 & C+\\
63 & 66.99 & C\\
60 & 62.99 & C-\\
55 & 59.99 & D+\\
50 & 54.99 & D\\
0 & 49.99 & F\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Letter grades may be increased, but not decreased from this benchmark if
overall grades prove lower than expected.

\hypertarget{section-coordination}{%
\section{Section Coordination}\label{section-coordination}}

The three fall sections of BUEC-311 will follow the same schedule with
the same deliverables. Given the size of the sections, it is preferable
that you attend your assigned section.

\hypertarget{teaching-assistants}{%
\section{Teaching Assistants}\label{teaching-assistants}}

There will be teaching assistants for each section. Once these details
are confirmed, I will update this outline. My expectation is that, in
addition to assisting with grading, the teaching assistants will be
available to help you with problem sets and course material at scheduled
times.

\hypertarget{communication}{%
\section{Communication}\label{communication}}

I'll generally use the ``Announcements'' tool in eClass to send you
messages relating to class content. I'll handle office hours and other
help requests via Google Meet or Zoom as the term progresses. You can
always email me with questions, but please put BUEC-311 in the subject
line as that will help me to make sure I don't miss your message.

\hypertarget{covid-times}{%
\section{COVID times}\label{covid-times}}

It's a difficult time for all of us. My goal is to make this class as
useful, rewarding, and engaging for you as I can during the term while
also making sure there are significant returns to hard work and
proficiency with the material. This is my first time teaching a course
on-line, and my first time teaching this course, and it's (likely) your
first full-semester on-line course. This means we've all got a lot to
learn, and that we'll have to be patient with technology and with each
other.

I am willing to help accommodate your personal circumstances to the best
of my abilities and within University policies. If you are in a position
where you require special accommodation, please let me know sooner
rather than later. If your circumstances change throughout the term, my
goal is to help you continue to be successful in the class. In return, I
ask that you keep in mind that faculty and staff at the university are
also adjusting to difficult times, and so your patience is going to be
required at times with new technology, new approaches, and (depending on
how things go) perhaps my kids invading your lectures. We'll make it
work.

\hypertarget{class-schedule}{%
\section{Class Schedule}\label{class-schedule}}

This is a rough outline for the semester. Actual class content may vary
over the course of the term and exam dates and deadlines to be finalized
closer to dates, and subject to University guidelines. Textbook
references are to the Perloff and Brander 3rd Edition text, although not
all material in each chapter will be covered, and supplemental material
will be added.
